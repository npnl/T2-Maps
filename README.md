Different structures (e.g., amgydala vs DLPFC) may be optimally imaged with different TEs, and this may vary across subjects. This package includes Mark Cohen's original Matlab based T2Map.m script to calculate an individual subject's T2Map from several TE protocols (e.g.,five files: TE=2.7, 5, 10, 20, 40). It also includes a wrapper for using .nii files and the potential to run multiple subjects at once (makeT2star.m) made by Bob and Lei, with normalizing suggestions by Kat, along with a TE_comparison image, and a group T2* median map example. Future versions of this package will provide optimized normalization for group maps and a processing stream in FSL. Requires Matlab, SPM5 or SPM8.
